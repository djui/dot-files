* Code skeletons for modules
* Fix folding
	+ I don't actually know what's not working or what's working but a note says it needs to be fixed
	+ Folding one-line functions fails, i.e.:
		fun(Args) -> body.
* Fix indent a pattern followed by a guard with `;' because it fails, i.e.:
	receive
		foo when foo == foo; foo != bur ->
			...
			...
* Fix omni completion, fails when omni completion is used twice on the same line with two different modules.
  autoload/erlangcomplete.vim needs fixing because fails to get the target token to be used as the module to
  be completed.
